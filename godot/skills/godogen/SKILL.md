# Game Generator — Orchestrator

Generate and update Godot games from natural language.

## Capabilities

Read each stage file from `${GODOGEN_SKILL_DIR}/` only when you reach that stage.

| File | Purpose | When to read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `visual-target.md` | Generate reference image | Pipeline start |
| `decomposer.md` | Decompose into task plan | After visual target |
| `scaffold.md` | Architecture + skeleton | After decomposition |
| `asset-planner.md` | Budget and plan assets | If budget provided |
| `asset-gen.md` | Asset generation CLI ref | When generating assets |
| `rembg.md` | Background removal | Only when an asset needs transparency removed |
| `task-execution.md` | Task workflow + commands | Before first task |
| `quirks.md` | Godot gotchas | Before writing code |
| `scene-generation.md` | Scene builders | Targets include `.tscn` |
| `test-harness.md` | SceneTree verification scripts | Before writing capture/test scripts |
| `capture.md` | Screenshot/video capture + final result bundle | Before automated screenshots or video |
| `android-build.md` | APK export | User requests Android |
| *(godot-api skill)* | C# Godot syntax ref | When unsure about Godot API details |

## Pipeline

```text
User request
    |
    +- Check if PLAN.md exists (resume check)
    |   +- If yes: read PLAN.md, STRUCTURE.md, MEMORY.md, ASSETS.md if present -> skip to task execution
    |   +- If no: continue with fresh pipeline below
    |
    +- Generate visual target -> reference.png + ASSETS.md (art direction only)
    +- Analyze risks + define verification criteria -> PLAN.md
    +- Design architecture -> STRUCTURE.md + project.godot + stubs
    |
    +- If budget provided (and no asset tables in ASSETS.md):
    |   +- Plan and generate assets -> ASSETS.md + updated PLAN.md with asset assignments
    |
    +- Show user a concise plan summary (risk tasks if any, main build scope)
    |
    +- Execute (see Execution below)
    |
    +- If final presentation media is required:
    |   +- Read test-harness.md and capture.md, produce a fresh screenshots/result/{N}/ bundle
    |
    +- If user requested Android app:
    |   +- Read android-build.md, export APK
    |
    +- Summary of completed game
```

## Assets

**If a budget is provided, generating proper assets is part of the task, not optional.** Do not fall back to procedural primitives when the budget allows a real asset — plan and generate through `asset-planner.md` / `asset-gen.md`. Procedural stand-ins are acceptable only for genuinely abstract shapes or when explicitly ruled out on budget grounds.

Placeholder primitives in gameplay code are a signal that the asset step was skipped — go back and generate the asset before continuing.

## Execution

Read `task-execution.md` before starting. Two phases:

1. **Risk tasks** (if any) — implement each in isolation, verify, commit
2. **Main build** — implement everything else, verify, present results, commit

If `PLAN.md` calls for presentation media, finish through the Godot test harness and capture flow and leave a fresh `screenshots/result/{N}/` proof bundle behind.

## Godot API Lookup

When you need to look up a Godot class API or C# Godot pattern, use the `godot-api` skill with a targeted query. It keeps large API docs out of the main pipeline.

Be specific about what you need:

- **Targeted query** — ask for specific methods, signals, or syntax: `"CharacterBody3D: what method applies velocity and slides along collisions?"`
- **Full API** — only when you need to survey the whole class: `"full API for AnimationPlayer"`

## Context Hygiene

Keep important state in files so the pipeline can resume cleanly:

- **PLAN.md** — task statuses and verification criteria
- **STRUCTURE.md** — architecture reference
- **MEMORY.md** — discoveries, quirks, workarounds, what worked or failed
- **ASSETS.md** — asset manifest with paths and generation details

After completing each task: update `PLAN.md`, write discoveries to `MEMORY.md`, and commit. If the thread becomes noisy, summarize the important state into those files and continue from the artifacts instead of relying on conversational memory.

## Visual Verification

**Do not trust code alone — verify on screenshots, captured frames, and video.** Code that looks correct often still ships broken placement, wrong scale, clipped geometry, missing elements, or bad motion timing.

When code and media disagree, trust the media. Be skeptical: the job is to find what is still broken, not to argue that it is probably fine. If a requirement is not clearly visible, treat it as not done.

Inspect captures directly while you work, then finish with a fresh `screenshots/result/{N}/` proof bundle containing `video.mp4` and the raw `frameXXX.png` sequence used to encode it.
